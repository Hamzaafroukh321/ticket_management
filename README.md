# Ticket Management

Ticket Management is a project that consists of a backend REST API built with Spring Boot, an Oracle XE database, and a Swing-based desktop client. The backend and Oracle DB are containerized using Docker Compose, while the Swing client is packaged as an executable JAR file that communicates with the backend via REST.
